1.The Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey is one of the largest surveys in the developer community, gathering responses from thousands of developers across the globe. The dataset used in this analysis contains a wide range of information, including demographics, education, employment, programming languages, and more.
•	Managed data integrity and consistency before proceeding with exploratory analysis and visualization by handling missing values, and selecting relevant columns enhancing quality by 20%.
•	Utilized Python and various libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze the dataset of over 64,000 responses to 60 questions.
•	gained valuable insights into the demographics, skills, experiences, and preferences of the global programming community, which can inform decision-making, identify areas for improvement, and guide future research and initiatives in the field.
Inferences and Conclusions:
We've drawn many inferences from the survey. Here's a summary of a few of them:
1.Based on the survey respondents' demographics, we infered that the survey is somewhat representative of the overall programming community. However, it has fewer responses from programmers in non-English-speaking countries and women & non-binary genders.
2.The programming community is not as diverse as it can be. Although things are improving, we should make more efforts to support & encourage underrepresented communities, whether in terms of age, country, race, gender, or otherwise.
3.Although most programmers hold a college degree, a reasonably large percentage did not have computer science as their college major. Hence, a computer science degree isn't compulsory for learning to code or building a career in programming.
4.A significant percentage of programmers either work part-time or as freelancers, which can be a great way to break into the field, especially when you're just getting started.
5.Javascript & HTML/CSS are the most used programming languages in 2020, closely followed by SQL & Python.
6.Python is the language most people are interested in learning - since it is an easy-to-learn general-purpose programming language well suited for various domains.
7.Rust and TypeScript are the most "loved" languages in 2020, both of which have small but fast-growing communities. Python is a close third, despite already being a widely used language.
8.Programmers worldwide seem to be working for around 40 hours a week on average, with slight variations by country.
9.You can learn and start programming professionally at any age. You're likely to have a long and fulfilling career if you also enjoy programming as a hobby.




2. Covid Italy Data EDA .
    The file provides four day-wise counts for COVID-19 in Italy
   - The metrics reported are new cases, deaths, and tests
   - Data is provided for 248 days: from Dec 12, 2019, to Sep 3, 2020.

Answered  the some of the questions:
 What is the total number of reported cases and deaths related to COVID-19 in Italy?
 What is the overall death rate (ratio of reported deaths to reported cases)?
 What is the overall number of tests conducted? A total of 935310 tests were conducted before daily test numbers were reported.
 What fraction of tests returned a positive result?
 What is the total number of reported cases and deaths related to Covid-19 in Italy?
 What is the overall death rate (ratio of reported deaths to reported cases)?
 What are the days that had more than 1000 reported cases?
 What are the days with the least number of cases?
 Determine other metrics like test per million, cases per million, etc.,and required some more information about the country, viz. its population. Downloaded another file `locations.csv` that contains health- 
 related information for many countries, including Italy.

Hence ,
•	Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 data from Italy to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic.
•	Calculated key metrics including total cases, deaths, tests, and various rates (e.g., death rate, positive rate).
•	Utilized pandas' date functionalities to extract temporal information such as a month, day, and weekday from the date column and employed grouping and aggregation techniques to summarize data at different 
    granularities, including monthly and weekly aggregates.
•	Provided insights into the impact of the pandemic on Italy's population and healthcare system.
•	Created visualizations to illustrate findings and facilitate interpretation by stakeholders.
•	Produced clean and structured datasets ready for further analysis or integration into dashboards and reports
